                As I sit down to pen this letter for Valentine's Day, my heart swells with an overwhelming
                sense of love and gratitude for having you in my life. You give me joy, warmth, and companionship. From
                the moment we met at the Ravenala Bridge, we formed a connection that words can only attempt to capture.
                I appreciate your presence everyday. Ours is a love that grows with each passing day and that has stayed
                strong even after everything that has happened. On this special day, l want you to know that my love for
                you is boundless, a force that transcends time and space and I am eternally grateful for the gift of
                you, Happy Valentine's Day, my love.May our love continue to blossom and flourish.
